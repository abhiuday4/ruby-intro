# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
puts 3
puts 5
puts 3 + 5
puts 3 * 5
puts 3 - 5
puts 3 / 5
puts 3 / 5.000 # Add .0 to 5 to ensure that there is a decimal output

# Non-numbers
puts "3 + 5"

# True, False
puts true
puts false

# Nothing

# Variables
x = 3
y = 5
puts x 
puts y
puts x + y
z = x + y
puts z 

# Combine strings and variables
puts "Tacos today's menu: #{x}"
puts "#{food} on today's menu: #{amount}" # name the variables something meaningful
# String manipulation
